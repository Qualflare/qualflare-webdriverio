 * `BodyLimit(10<<20)`), and a rejected request loses the ENTIRE launch — not
 * just the oversized attachment, so a path that skips the budget can silently
 * destroy a whole run's results.
 *
 * The budget is spent in ENCODED bytes, because base64 is what the body limit
 * measures. A raw-byte budget understated the cost by 4/3.
 *
 * The budget covers a smaller population than it used to. Screenshots no longer
 * inline at all — they are written into `outputDir` and referenced by
 * `localImagePath` (see `image-writer.ts`), so they are not in the request body
 * and do not draw on this. What remains here is text: logs, JSON, markdown.
